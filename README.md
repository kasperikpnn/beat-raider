# BeatRaider

BeatRaider is an audio uploading and streaming service, most similar to SoundCloud.

The user can:

- log in and out, and create a new account
- upload new music on the platform
- have a profile page that displays their music (with possibly a basic description set by the user)
- listen to other people's music and receive "medals" on their profile page (ex. "Biggest Rock Listener of the Day", "Most Listens on "Lady Gaga - Poker Face" This Month")
- increase the play count of other people's songs (not their own) by listening
- (maybe leave comments and have a basic follow/unfollow system, or reposts: that will be determined later)
- search for songs containing a specific name or genre, songs that were uploaded today/this week/...

The songs:
- have a title, and an artist/multiple artists
- have an upload date/time
- have a genre set by the uploader
- have a play count determined by how many times another user has pressed play on the song
