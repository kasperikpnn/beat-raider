# beat-raider

BeatRaider is an audio uploading and streaming service, most similar to SoundCloud.

The user can:

- log in and out, and create a new account
- upload new music on the platform
- listen to other people's music and receive "medals" (ex. "Biggest Rock Listener of the Day")
- increase the play count of other people's songs (not their own) by listening
- have a profile page that displays their music and medals
- (maybe leave comments and have a basic follow/unfollow system, or reposts: that will be determined later)
- search for songs containing a specific name, or genre

The songs:
- have a genre set by the uploader
- have a play count determined by how many times another user has pressed play on the song
